Traffic-Crash-Analysis
## Description  
This project investigates the relationships between traffic crash characteristics and injury severity using **SAS** for statistical analysis. Techniques such as **descriptive statistics**, **factor analysis**, **multiple regression**, and **clustering** were applied to uncover patterns and actionable insights for improving road safety.  

## Key Features  
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarized key metrics to identify injury trends.  
- **Factor Analysis**: Extracted latent factors influencing crash severity, such as Distance Factor and Intersection Factor.  
- **Regression Models**: Built predictive models for Minor, Moderate, and Fatal Injuries based on crash attributes.  
- **Cluster Analysis**: Grouped crashes into clusters to identify high-risk scenarios.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Tools**: SAS (Statistical Analysis System)  
- **Techniques**: Descriptive Statistics, Factor Analysis, Regression Modeling, K-Means Clustering  

## Results  
- Significant correlation between crashes involving city property damage and moderate/fatal injuries.  
- Latent factors such as Distance and Intersection counts play a critical role in injury severity.  
- Clustering highlighted geographic zones prone to specific types of injuries, enabling targeted interventions.
